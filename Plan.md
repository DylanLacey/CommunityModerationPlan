# Slack Moderation Plan
## Who is responsible for Moderation?
Moderation is the responsibility of the Community Team, in line with our desired atmosphere and the Code of Conduct.  The Slack is a professional venue akin to a conference; We want to be fun and engaging, while maintaining trustworthy, work-appropriate vibes.  The desired goal is to be a digital watercooler.

## Dealing with Issues
### Reporting
Violations can be reported via a message `@admins` to notify all Slack admins of a problem.  Alternatively, they may choose to DM, or send an email.

Our priority when dealing with issues should to 
1: Fulfill any legal requirements 
2: Make sure the reporter feels heard and safe
3: To ensure the Community as a whole is safe.  

### Content in need of Moderation
Content which is offensive, illegal, or overly commercial in nature should be removed.

If Content is not in appropriate, but is not in and of itself offensive, illegal, or overly commercial in nature does not need to be removed.  Instead, moderators should message the author and inform them why the content is not appropriate.  They may also choose to reply to a thread or in public, informing the community as a whole that the content is inappropriate.

### Warnings and Bans
*Moderators have full discretion RE warnings and bans.*

Community members engaging in inappropriate behaviour should be given a warning if a Moderator feels the behaviour was accidental or not ill-intentioned.

If a moderator feels a Community member's behaviour is intentional, obviously inappropriate, or that it is otherwise warranted, they should ban the member:
1. Send the member a message telling them they are being banned for inappropriate behaviour.
2. Ban the member.

### Notification of action
If a warning or ban was the result of a report from a Community member, that member should be told that the warning or bad was made.  There is no need to go into further details.

If the warning or ban was for un-reported bad behavious, the moderator _may_ choose to post a message in `#off-topic` to the effect that someone was banned for a specific behaviour.  You should *not* include the member's name.  Use the following template: 

> Hi everyone; We have had to ban a member for {conduct_violation}.  We want to make sure that Sauce Squad is a fun, professional environment; If you need to report any issues, please contact @admins.

### Dealing with Commercial Interests
It is _totally appropriate_ for our Community to be discussing alternatives to Sauce Labs in our Community.  

It is not appropriate for our competitors to:
* Promote their products
* Denigrate our products
* Engage in Sealioning or other attempts to use our resources

Ban them.

### Privileged Information
#### Pricing
Customers should not discuss Contract terms in the Slack.  If a customer mentions price figures for anything besides Self Service, kindly ask them to remove them.  If they don't comply, delete the message.

#### Access Keys
If a customer posts their access key, either directly or in linked code, ask them to immediately rotate it in the Sauce Labs interface.
